# gt-coding-quiz

## Description
This webpage serves as a coding quiz. It generates the the questions and answer choices dynamically by intializing through an array containing the question/answer objects. A timer begins when the user presses the "start button." When the user chooses a wrong answer, their time is reduced by fifteen seconds, and they will be notified that it was the wrong choice. In turn, if their choice is correct, they will be accurately notified. Each click of a selection cycles to the next index. The final score is the time remaining on the quiz. Eventually, the user will be able to save their highscores, but for now that is not implemented.
